/**
 * This endpoint is used to fetch a day-by-day snapshot of a customer's costs in Orb, calculated by
 * applying pricing information to the underlying usage (see the
 * [subscription usage endpoint](/api-reference/subscription/fetch-subscription-usage) to fetch
 * usage per metric, in usage units rather than a currency).
 *
 * This endpoint can be leveraged for internal tooling and to provide a more transparent billing
 * experience for your end users:
 * 1. Understand the cost breakdown per line item historically and in real-time for the current
 *    billing period.
 * 2. Provide customer visibility into how different services are contributing to the overall
 *    invoice with a per-day timeseries (as compared to the
 *    [upcoming invoice](/api-reference/invoice/fetch-upcoming-invoice) resource, which represents a
 *    snapshot for the current period).
 * 3. Assess how minimums and discounts affect your customers by teasing apart costs directly as a
 *    result of usage, as opposed to minimums and discounts at the plan and price level.
 * 4. Gain insight into key customer health metrics, such as the percent utilization of the minimum
 *    committed spend.
 *
 * ## Fetching subscriptions
 *
 * By default, this endpoint fetches the currently active subscription for the customer, and returns
 * cost information for the subscription's current billing period, broken down by each participating
 * price. If there are no currently active subscriptions, this will instead default to the most
 * recently active subscription or return an empty series if none are found. For example, if your
 * plan charges for compute hours, job runs, and data syncs, then this endpoint would provide a
 * daily breakdown of your customer's cost for each of those axes.
 *
 * If timeframe bounds are specified, Orb fetches all subscriptions that were active in that
 * timeframe. If two subscriptions overlap on a single day, costs from each price will be summed,
 * and prices for both subscriptions will be included in the breakdown.
 *
 * ## Prepaid plans
 *
 * For plans that include prices which deduct credits rather than accrue in-arrears charges in a
 * billable currency, this endpoint will return the total deduction amount, in credits, for the
 * specified timeframe.
 *
 * ## Cumulative subtotals and totals
 *
 * Since the subtotal and total must factor in any billing-period level discounts and minimums, it's
 * most meaningful to consider costs relative to the start of the subscription's billing period. As
 * a result, by default this endpoint returns cumulative totals since the beginning of the billing
 * period. In particular, the `timeframe_start` of a returned timeframe window is _always_ the
 * beginning of the billing period and `timeframe_end` is incremented one day at a time to build the
 * result.
 *
 * A customer that uses a few API calls a day but has a minimum commitment might exhibit the
 * following pattern for their subtotal and total in the first few days of the month. Here, we
 * assume that each API call is \$2.50, the customer's plan has a monthly minimum of \$50 for this
 * price, and that the subscription's billing period bounds are aligned to the first of the month:
 *
 * | timeframe_start | timeframe_end | Cumulative usage | Subtotal | Total (incl. commitment) |
 * |-----------------|---------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------|
 * | 2023-02-01      | 2023-02-02    | 9                | \$22.50  | \$50.00                  |
 * | 2023-02-01      | 2023-02-03    | 19               | \$47.50  | \$50.00                  |
 * | 2023-02-01      | 2023-02-04    | 20               | \$50.00  | \$50.00                  |
 * | 2023-02-01      | 2023-02-05    | 28               | \$70.00  | \$70.00                  |
 * | 2023-02-01      | 2023-02-06    | 36               | \$90.00  | \$90.00                  |
 *
 * ### Periodic values
 *
 * When the query parameter `view_mode=periodic` is specified, Orb will return an incremental
 * day-by-day view of costs. In this case, there will always be a one-day difference between
 * `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end` for the timeframes returned. This is a transform on top of
 * the cumulative costs, calculated by taking the difference of each timeframe with the last. Note
 * that in the above example, the `Total` value would be 0 for the second two data points, since the
 * minimum commitment has not yet been hit and each day is not contributing anything to the total
 * cost.
 *
 * ## Timeframe bounds
 *
 * For an active subscription, both timeframes should be specified in the request. If a subscription
 * starts or ends within the timeframe, the response will only include windows where the
 * subscription is active. If a subscription has ended, no timeframe bounds need to be specified and
 * the response will default to the billing period when the subscription was last active.
 *
 * As noted above, `timeframe_start` for a given cumulative datapoint is always the beginning of the
 * billing period, and `timeframe_end` is incremented one day at a time to construct the response.
 * When a timeframe is passed in that is not aligned to the current subscription's billing period,
 * the response will contain cumulative totals from multiple billing periods.
 *
 * Suppose the queried customer has a subscription aligned to the 15th of every month. If this
 * endpoint is queried with the date range `2023-06-01` - `2023-07-01`, the first data point will
 * represent about half a billing period's worth of costs, accounting for accruals from the start of
 * the billing period and inclusive of the first day of the timeframe (`timeframe_start = 2023-05-15
 * 00:00:00`, `timeframe_end = 2023-06-02 00:00:00`)
 *
 * | datapoint index | timeframe_start | timeframe_end |
 * |-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
 * | 0               | 2023-05-15      | 2023-06-02    |
 * | 1               | 2023-05-15      | 2023-06-03    |
 * | 2               | ...             | ...           |
 * | 3               | 2023-05-15      | 2023-06-14    |
 * | 4               | 2023-06-15      | 2023-06-16    |
 * | 5               | 2023-06-15      | 2023-06-17    |
 * | 6               | ...             | ...           |
 * | 7               | 2023-06-15      | 2023-07-01    |
 *
 * You can see this sliced timeframe visualized [here](https://i.imgur.com/TXhYgme.png).
 *
 * ### Matrix prices
 *
 * When a price uses matrix pricing, it's important to view costs grouped by those matrix
 * dimensions. Orb will return `price_groups` with the `grouping_key` and `secondary_grouping_key`
 * based on the matrix price definition, for each `grouping_value` and `secondary_grouping_value`
 * available.
