/**
 * This endpoint can be used to change an existing subscription's plan. It returns the serialized
 * updated subscription object.
 *
 * The body parameter `change_option` determines when the plan change occurs. Orb supports three
 * options:
 * - `end_of_subscription_term`: changes the plan at the end of the existing plan's term.
 *     - Issuing this plan change request for a monthly subscription will keep the existing plan
 *       active until the start of the subsequent month. Issuing this plan change request for a
 *       yearly subscription will keep the existing plan active for the full year. Charges incurred
 *       in the remaining period will be invoiced as normal.
 *     - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is made on January
 *       15th, so the plan will be changed on February 1st, and invoice will be issued on February
 *       1st for the last month of the original plan.
 * - `immediate`: changes the plan immediately.
 *     - Subscriptions that have their plan changed with this option will move to the new plan
 *       immediately, and be invoiced immediately.
 *     - This invoice will include any usage fees incurred in the billing period up to the change,
 *       along with any prorated recurring fees for the billing period, if applicable.
 *     - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is made on January
 *       15th, so the plan will be changed on January 15th, and an invoice will be issued for the
 *       partial month, from January 1 to January 15, on the original plan.
 * - `requested_date`: changes the plan on the requested date (`change_date`).
 *     - If no timezone is provided, the customer's timezone is used. The `change_date` body
 *       parameter is required if this option is chosen.
 *     - Example: The plan is billed monthly on the 1st of the month, the request is made on January
 *       15th, with a requested `change_date` of February 15th, so the plan will be changed on
 *       February 15th, and invoices will be issued on February 1st and February 15th.
 *
 * Note that one of `plan_id` or `external_plan_id` is required in the request body for this
 * operation.
 *
 * ## Customize your customer's subscriptions
 *
 * Prices and adjustments in a plan can be added, removed, or replaced on the subscription when you
 * schedule the plan change. This is useful when a customer has prices that differ from the default
 * prices for a specific plan.
 *
 * <Note> This feature is only available for accounts that have migrated to Subscription Overrides
 * Version 2. You can find your Subscription Overrides Version at the bottom of your
 * [Plans page](https://app.withorb.com/plans) </Note>
 *
 * ### Adding Prices
 *
 * To add prices, provide a list of objects with the key `add_prices`. An object in the list must
 * specify an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or `external_price_id` field, or create a new
 * add-on price by including an object with the key `price`, identical to what would be used in the
 * request body for the [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
 * [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of different price
 * model configurations possible in this object.
 *
 * If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with `plan_phase_order` key
 * to indicate which phase the price should be added to.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional `end_date`. If
 * `start_date` is unspecified, the start of the phase / plan change time will be used. If
 * `end_date` is unspecified, it will finish at the end of the phase / have no end time.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`, `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`.
 * This will create adjustments which apply only to this price.
 *
 * Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This ID can be used
 * to reference this price when [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same API call.
 * However the ID is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API calls.
 *
 * ### Removing Prices
 *
 * To remove prices, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_prices`. An object in the list
 * must specify a plan price with either a `price_id` or `external_price_id` field.
 *
 * ### Replacing Prices
 *
 * To replace prices, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_prices`. An object in the list
 * must specify a plan price to replace with the `replaces_price_id` key, and it must specify a
 * price to replace it with by either referencing an existing add-on price with a `price_id` or
 * `external_price_id` field, or by creating a new add-on price by including an object with the key
 * `price`, identical to what would be used in the request body for the
 * [create price endpoint](/api-reference/price/create-price). See the
 * [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the specification of different price
 * model configurations possible in this object.
 *
 * For fixed fees, an object in the list can supply a `fixed_price_quantity` instead of a `price`,
 * `price_id`, or `external_price_id` field. This will update only the quantity for the price,
 * similar to the [Update price quantity](/api-reference/subscription/update-price-quantity)
 * endpoint.
 *
 * The replacement price will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same start and end dates
 * as the price it replaces.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `minimum_amount`, `maximum_amount`, or `discounts`.
 * This will create adjustments which apply only to this price.
 *
 * Additionally, an object in the list can specify an optional `reference_id`. This ID can be used
 * to reference the replacement price when [adding an adjustment](#adding-adjustments) in the same
 * API call. However the ID is _transient_ and cannot be used to refer to the price in future API
 * calls.
 *
 * ### Adding adjustments
 *
 * To add adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `add_adjustments`. An object in the
 * list must include an object with the key `adjustment`, identical to the adjustment object in the
 * [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
 *
 * If the plan has phases, each object in the list must include a number with `plan_phase_order` key
 * to indicate which phase the adjustment should be added to.
 *
 * An object in the list can specify an optional `start_date` and optional `end_date`. If
 * `start_date` is unspecified, the start of the phase / plan change time will be used. If
 * `end_date` is unspecified, it will finish at the end of the phase / have no end time.
 *
 * ### Removing adjustments
 *
 * To remove adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `remove_adjustments`. An object in
 * the list must include a key, `adjustment_id`, with the ID of the adjustment to be removed.
 *
 * ### Replacing adjustments
 *
 * To replace adjustments, provide a list of objects with the key `replace_adjustments`. An object
 * in the list must specify a plan adjustment to replace with the `replaces_adjustment_id` key, and
 * it must specify an adjustment to replace it with by including an object with the key
 * `adjustment`, identical to the adjustment object in the
 * [add/edit price intervals endpoint](/api-reference/price-interval/add-or-edit-price-intervals).
 *
 * The replacement adjustment will have the same phase, if applicable, and the same start and end
 * dates as the adjustment it replaces.
 *
 * ## Price overrides (DEPRECATED)
 *
 * <Note> Price overrides are being phased out in favor adding/removing/replacing prices. (See
 * [Customize your customer's subscriptions](/api-reference/subscription/schedule-plan-change))
 * </Note>
 *
 * Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in a plan for the specific subscription
 * being created. This is useful when a new customer has negotiated a rate that is unique to the
 * customer.
 *
 * To override prices, provide a list of objects with the key `price_overrides`. The price object in
 * the list of overrides is expected to contain the existing price id, the `model_type` and
 * configuration. (See the [Price resource](/product-catalog/price-configuration) for the
 * specification of different price model configurations.) The numerical values can be updated, but
 * the billable metric, cadence, type, and name of a price can not be overridden.
 *
 * ### Maximums, and minimums
 * Price overrides are used to update some or all prices in the target plan. Minimums and maximums,
 * much like price overrides, can be useful when a new customer has negotiated a new or different
 * minimum or maximum spend cap than the default for the plan. The request format for maximums and
 * minimums is the same as those in [subscription creation](create-subscription).
 *
 * ## Scheduling multiple plan changes
 * When scheduling multiple plan changes with the same date, the latest plan change on that day
 * takes effect.
 *
 * ## Prorations for in-advance fees
 * By default, Orb calculates the prorated difference in any fixed fees when making a plan change,
 * adjusting the customer balance as needed. For details on this behavior, see
 * [Modifying subscriptions](/product-catalog/modifying-subscriptions#prorations-for-in-advance-fees).
